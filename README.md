# dataforgood 
This is Team Campus Cults' final project analysis of Kickstarter data for Statistics 131 at UCLA.

Our **final report** is in the jupyter notebook  **"Final_Report.ipynb"**

A **supplemental** exploratory analysis notebook **"Plotly_Supplemental_Exploratory_Analysis.ipynb"** can be viewed here: http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hannah-ross/dataforgood/blob/master/Plotly_Supplemental_Exploratory_Analysis.ipynb 

Our **project presentation video** can be viewed on youtube here: **https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSZCPRbuOD8&feature=youtu.be**

Our **presentation slides** themselves can be viewed in **"project_slides.pdf"**

# Project Organization
### data
a folder containing the Kickstarter data set

### background_info
a folder to document background information, common knowledge, and discussion of variables
- discussion of each of the variables included in the dataset, and what the observational unit is
- discussion of how the data is collected
- “Common knowledge” shared among relevant parties involved
- a review of other related research or studies that have been done

### exploratory_analysis
a folder for code exploring the data  (view in http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ )
- any data cleaning and new derived features
- summary statistics
- outliers
- interesting relationships
- readable tables, graphs, and explanatory commentary

### modeling
a folder for code fitting a statistical model to data for prediction
- explain decisions regarding the choice of model, and the reasoning behind the inclusion of predictive features. (Probably backed up by the findings in the exploratory data analysis.)
- seperate training and testing data to fit a model for predictive purposes
- cross-validation to ensure that the model is not overfitting features unique to the training data. A metric will need to be selected to show the predictive performance of the model.
